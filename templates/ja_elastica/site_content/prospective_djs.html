<p>We're posting this on our website so we can direct interested people to this info for future reference. Every year, we get approached from hopeful artists all over the country/world to DJ at our camp. We appreciate the interest sincerely, but only have slots for very few people outside our camp members/residents, friends who've helped us by playing at our fundraisers in San Francisco and international talent we've invited to come play, whom all offer to play our fundraisers throughout the year.</p>

<p>Essentially, if you're not able to support our efforts in a significant way (like being an internationally-known DJ willing to play a benefit for us, or someone that can offer us a notable gig exchange at your sound camp or local party scene elsewhere in the country/world, or a DJ we already have a strong relationship with, it's highly unlikely we can create a spot for you no matter how amazing of a DJ you are. We're sorry, that's just simply how it works. The easiest way to get a slot at OT is to join the camp. Conversely, you can consider starting your own sound camp at Burning Man. So if you want to consider joining our camp so you can DJ, that is possible in the future (though unlikely for the year you join) - info on that below.</p>

<h4 class="subhead">Opulent Temple DJs</h4>
<p>There are 3 categories of Opulent Temple DJs depending on what you're able to contribute based on your time.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="shiva"><strong>OT CORE:</strong> The OT Core are the DJs who have made a multi-year committment and are on hand when things need to happen, almost without fail. These guys (and girl) give their blood, sweat, tears, time, money, and a heroic effort in set up and more importantly, Strike in brutal conditions. For that and their on going commitment to keep the OT alive throughout the year they play the choice slots at BM and our OT parties. They are Syd Gris, Dutch, Vinkalmann, Billy Seal, Billy Casazza, Cosmic Selector, Dex Stakker, Drew Drop, Jeff Taisch, Dulce Vita and Brian Peek.</li>
  <li class="shiva"><strong>OT OG:</strong> a dj who has camped with us at least one year, helps with either truck loading (pre-BM) or unloading (post BM), arrives by Sunday (start of week) at 3pm to help build the camp, plays a significant role in the summer projects (meaning you show up and work more than a couple times), plays a significant role in summer fundraisers (meaning you don't just show up and play, but instead take a leadership role without being asked to) and who stays until Strike is DONE on <strong>Monday</strong> (not Sunday night) at Burning Man will play usually 1-2 decent slots.</li>
  <li class="shiva"><strong>OT DJ:</strong> a dj who has camped with us at least one year, has made notable contributions in the past, is physically camping with us, and meets basic camp member requirements of participation, <strong>including participating in Strike</strong>, can get <strong>one</strong> slot, -OR- a new member who kicks ass in a notable fashion. Returning members will have deference for quality of set times.</li>
</ul>
 <p>DJs that can not help with Strike will rarely be able to be scheduled. If there are (very) special circumstances that prevent one from helping at Strike, we can discuss further. Due to the increased number of camp DJs, and more importantly an increase in the number of those camp DJs able and willing to put in significant amounts of time, we have had to raise the bar for everyone, even long standing members. We realize this will not make certain members happy. We think knowing the history of how we ended up in this place, everyone has to understand, whether they agree or not with it, why this is fair.</p>
 <p>We welcome anyone who has the gusto to start their own camp and we can offer to collaborate on resources. Furthermore, despite everything stated above, we still have a certain musical vision for the Opulent Temple that is core to why it was started in the first place. (A hip hop DJ who busts ass for us will still not play at our camp) That vision is a premium on variety night to night, with an emphasis on Electronic Dance Music: electro / house, progressive, breaks, techno, tech house, live electronica and trance. A dash of dubstep is inevitable, but there's plenty of camps doing that at BM already. It's no secret we're not huge on the all out banging psy-trance or drum n' bass, but obviously there's room for those making significant contributions - to a point (Aphrodite and Infected Mushroom are a prime example). We don't program reggae, dub, ragga, glitch, grind, mash ups, happy hardcore, commercial hip hop / dance music, etc. No disrespect, but that's just not our thing. The range of past guests we've had pretty much speaks for itself. On the other hand, there are also certain points in the week where we want to smash-up the dancefloor a little bit, and if that's not your sound then please don't be miffed if you're not scheduled during those times!</p>
