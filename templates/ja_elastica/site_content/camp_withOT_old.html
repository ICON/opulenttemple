<h4 class="subhead">The Opulent Temple 2012 is now full and no longer accepting camp members. Thank you for your support, see you on our dancefloor!</h4>
<p>If you want to make a contribution to the event in a special way, helping us raise, rock and take down the OT is one way to do it. We approach the entire process as an exercise in fun and community and we hope you will as well. You may also find taking part in large scale joy creation is quite rewarding.</p>
<p>No particular skills are needed, but we're of course looking for any help with construction, design, lighting, visuals, welding, art project ideas, organizing and project management, fund raising, driving, and the like... Mostly we're looking for solid, nice, conscientious and reliable people who know how to balance work and play.</p>
<p>We don't take everybody that's interested. We're big on the right vibe and match of people. We'll need to hear why you're interested and why you think it's a good match for what kind of BM experience you want to have. (We also want to be sure you know what you're getting yourself into!) If you're in the Bay Area you'll need to attend a camp wide meeting before BM. If you're not, ideally (not always) you need to know someone in the camp. You DON'T need to bust ass before and on the playa to join us. You don't even have to work that hard. Of course we'd love you to, but there's a slot for most any kind of person that meets the criteria above.</p>
<p>For most, basic camp requirements are the ability to pay camp dues, an effort to help out as you can before the playa in any number of ways if you're in the SF area, taking on some limited responsibilities while at Burning Man, and contributing to the break down of the camp (Strike). (Or you can skip most of that with higher dues)</p>
<p>Our camp utilizes dues to help meet our budget. Those arriving by Saturday (early arrival) at sunset pay $50 because in most cases they will have the most work to do in setting up the camp. Theses early arrival spots are already taken by returning members. Spots left are for those paying $100 and- for those that want very little work responsibilities, you can pay $250 or $300.</p>
<p>What do you get for your dues? As a camp member, you'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 serving of a BBQ meat dish that is cooked nightly Tuesday through Friday night. This is part of your dues and you don't need to do anything except show up with a plate a little before sunset on those nights.</li>
<li>an option for a much more extensive meal plan you can pay into for nightly full vegetarian meals provided by <a href="http://krishnakitchen.org/" target="_blank">Krishna Kitchen</a> on site. The meals are, on their own, plenty to sustain you, but will also be somewhat coordinated with the meat dish for that night. This will include 2-3 meals a day depending on what you sign up for directly with Krishna Kitchen.</li>
<li>an excellent place to spend the week with good &amp; talented people, where you are never far from the fun.</li>
<li>a community shade area w/ carpeting, couches, pillow, chill space, etc.</li>
<li>a community kitchen with stoves, cooking gear, BBQ pits, etc. so you can cook things for yourself.</li>
<li>generator access for your tent (additional $20 + dues) or RV additional $50 + dues</li>
<li>community showers (some water available, but you shoud still bring your own)</li>
<li>For RV's - the ability to pay into a fund that will give us our own private pumping truck so you don't have to race down the 'Johnny on the Spot' guys.</li>
<li>For RV's - the ability to pay into a fund for daily water refills.</li>
<li>And of course, you're part of the Opulent Temple, with all the joy and purpose that comes with it, and the view of the prime real estate of the 10:00 corner.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 2 options to join if we're a good match for you and vice-versa.</p>

<p><strong>Dues are $300.</strong> Opulent Camper, No set up, strike or hosting or kitchen shift sign ups</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Helping before Burning Man:</h4>
<p>For regular camp members paying, if you're in the SF area, we expect you'll make a good faith effort to contribute to the pre-playa prep. This could be putting in some time building things at the Box Shop where we work out of, going shopping for decoration or infrastructure needs, helping with one of the fund raising parties, helping coordinate transportation or production needs, or any number of ways to contribute to the workings of the Tribe.</p>
