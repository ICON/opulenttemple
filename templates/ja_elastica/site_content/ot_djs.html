<p>“I can still clearly remember the day I discovered electronic music. Standing in front of a speaker (still my favorite place), at a Friends and Family party in San Francisco. Something clicked, it made sense. While a lot of memories fade over time, that one doesn’t. The hard part came next. I knew I needed more of this music, but where to start? It wasn’t until a co-worker gave me Dave Seaman’s Renaissance Awakening that I knew where I wanted to be, and have never looked back. I’m now the guy will reply with a blank stare if asked about current non-electronic music.”</p>
<p>Matt’s weapon of choice is Ableton Live. If one can think it, one can probably do it with this software, with enough work. Creativity is the only limiting factor. Matt’s been using Ableton for a three year’s at this point, and has only begun to crack into its possibilities. His mixes are frequently featured on Frisky Radio and the ProgressiveHouse.com’s ProgCast. He is a regular contributor at www.AbletonLiveDj.com, a website dedicated to increasing the knowledge pool centered around using Ableton Live as a DJ tool.</p>
<p>Matt got involved with Opulent Temple at Burning Man in 2005 and has been playing with them since. He digs the thriving underground scene in San Francisco and enjoys the open-minded, conscious people that are drawn to electronic music.</p>
<p>“I take pride in making each mix a standalone story. Making each mix its own ride allows me to not be tied down to a particular style, and keeps things fresh. I feel alive when mixing, and hope the listener enjoys what I’m trying to say.”</p>

<p>The latest mix CD by Billy Casazza is entitled It’s Not Me It’s The Music, but he’s really just being humble. Because while somebody else could run out and buy the same records, nobody could spin the way he does, building an escapable vice that commands you to move. “I have always been around dance music and dancing, even when I was Kid,” says Casazza. Growing up on a diet of Front 242, New Order, Kraftwerk, and Nizter Ebb, it wasn’t long before he found electronic music and the love affair truly began. “The first time I heard electronic music I was hooked. I bought records for my friends to spin at all the high school dances in the late 80’s, at that time I had now idea how to DJ.” Although he admits that his main goal at the time was just dancing with the girls. During the early rave days he bounced around from party to party, in 97 he started to DJ out of frustration with the tired sounds he was hearing on the dance floor. “I figured I could buy the records I loved and play them-If they didn’t make me dance I wouldn’t buy them. I still live by that rule.</p>
<p>Honing his skills and developing an unique blend of dark funky, tribal sounds, progressive and electro, and plenty of breaks for the dancers, Casazza quickly moved beyond the confines of California’s Central Valley where he is based, growing a devoted following in San Francisco’s best clubs. 1015, Ruby Skye, Mighty, Anu, 111 Minna, Mezzanine-Casazza has played them all, Djing alongside the likes of Dj Dan, Paul Oakenfold, Scumfrog, Rabbit in the Moon, Terry Mullan, Gene Farris, Hipp-e, Spesh, Soulslinger, RPO, Dylan Rhymes, Doc Martin, Garth, John Howard. As word of his talents spread he began getting International gigs. He played parties in Portugal, Romania, Egypt, Bali, Java, Mexico, Thailand, Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan, and Panama have all been rocked by Casazza.</p>
<p>His Favorite gig? “Opulent Temple at Burning Man is always an experience, but Ecosystem 2.0 in the Amazon Rain Forest in front of 2000 people as the sun was coming up. I had to play after Ken Ishi and a psychtrance Dj, but some how, some way, everyone stuck around smiling and dancing, going off until 10 in the morning, .” It’s a long way from his first gig ( a tequila-fueled house party with the typically annoying request for commercial Hip Hop) but Casazza is a natural in front of crowds, whether its festivals like Burning Man or SF’s Love Fest Parade or the smallest dive bar.</p>
<p>As Casazza continues to travel, and holds down a residency at Anu called Dose, and Opulent Temple, the next step is to focus on his own Label Nutbass Records. Nutbass has already released two 12”s that have been played by the likes of Jerry Bohnam, Gabriel and Dresden and Jondi and Spesh and have received good reviews in BPM, but Casazza wants more. The best thing in the world is to play your own songs and watch everyone dance and have fun,” he says. “My goal is to play just my own music. I think then I could consider myself a true artist” All modesty aside, just ask anyone losing it to one of his sets-they will tell you he is already an artist of the highest order.</p>

In recent past, Dulce was named WINNER of SF Weekly: City of Spin 2009 (Annual DJ Competition) and her performance at Burning Man earned a prestigious mention by the Editor-in-Chief in international publication 'DJ Mag' (2008 issue featuring Top 100).</p>

<p>Without doubt, DJ ICON has become an iconic figure in the U.S. dance music industry and beyond. With a career spanning a decade-and-a-half, she has captivated audiences the world over with her signature bass-heavy, vocal-infused, cross-genre Bass Music sound; magnetic stage presence, skillful DJ mixes and productions on Illeven Eleven Recordings. It’s no wonder why she’s been dubbed one of the leading ladies of this domain.</p>
<p>Starting in 1996 at age 16, ICON diligently rose through the ranks of the San Francisco underground at a time when female DJs and promoters were few. In just a few years, her skills and growing reputation had already landed her numerous residencies in San Francisco, as well as a steady flow of multi-national bookings. ICON has also gained success in radio and television in addition to rocking dancefloors worldwide. Among her accolades are stellar reviews for her productions on Illeven Eleven Recordings, a spot in Shejay’s “Top 100 Female DJs”, being voted one of San Francisco’s best in the Nitevibe “Top 10 DJ Dreamteam” Poll, and also scoring a coveted sponsorship from Pioneer Pro DJ.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, ICON has regularly toured throughout the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe and Asia at world renowned clubs such as 1015 Folsom and Ruby Skye in San Francisco, Limelight in NYC, Fabric and Matter in London, and Avalon in LA; as well as massive events such as Coachella Music Festival, Ultra Music Festival, Burning Man and Fuel Festival in Singapore. ICON has shared stages with top tier artists such as Underworld, The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method, Ladytron, Paul Oakenfold, Adam Freeland, Armand Van Helden, Deekline &amp; Wizard, The Stanton Warriors, The Freestylers, Evil Nine, Elite Force, Uberzone, Bassbin Twins, DJ Icey, DJ Rap and many more.</p>
<p>In addition to her international touring, ICON has also promoted many events in San Francisco and New York City over the years, including her Weapon of Choice series featuring the best international talent alongside local heroes. This led to her popular Weapon of Choice DJ mix series that has accumulated over 20,000 downloads and thousands of plays on Soundcloud and Mixcloud. She is also an integral member of the first female DJ collective, Sister SF, and the well-known large-scale sound camp at Burning Man, Opulent Temple.</p>
<p>For many years, ICON dominated the radio waves with residencies and guest spots on a plethora of successful long-running dance music programs such as Thump Funk on XM, Boombox Mix Sessions on Sirius, Solid State on K-ROCK in NYC; IBreaks in the UK; and a myriad of shows in the San Francisco Bay Area, including House Nation on Wild 94.9 FM, Subsonic on Live 105, Zendada on Energy 92.7, and Future Breaks on KUSF. She has also made her way onto the small screen: In 2001, she was featured as one of twelve up-and-coming American DJs in “Disc Jockey,” a 12-part documentary series that aired on Showtime™ and ShoNext™. In 2004, she was the DJ on the internationally syndicated MTV™ series “The Wade Robson Project,” a dance competition hosted by the self-titled super choreographer.</p>
<p>ICON’s production endeavors have proven to be as exciting as her DJ career. Her first release on Illeven Eleven Recordings “Welcome To My Dancefloor”, a collaboration with Dustin Hulton featuring vocals by Nikki Carabello, had huge support by leading artists in the industry. It charted at #8 and #22 on the Beatport Breakbeat and Electro charts, also getting stellar reviews in Mixmag and Beatport top weekly picks. Her second release, “Wha?”, with studio partner Ground_Control, had equally stellar support and reviews; the Keith Mackenzie &amp; DJ Fixx remix charted at #12 on Beatport. Since then, ICON &amp; Ground_Control have been on a warpath making beats under their new moniker, ICONtrol. So what’s next for this powerhouse bass princess? More ICONtrol originals and remixes are in the works, as she continues to make her mark in the worldwide dance music industry. And if the last fifteen years have proven anything, the future will continue to bring big things from this driven and versatile performer.</p>

<p>Brian Peek, resident DJ with Opulent Temple, is no newcomer to the industry. Rocking prime size crowds in San Francisco for the past six years, Brian focuses on mixing the highest quality of tunes across his full range of psy-breaks, electro, tech house, midtempo nu funk breaks, and downtempo. Dance floors at clubs and undergrounds all over the city have been mezmerized by the special touches he incorporates into his mixes, often encompassing sounds that have dirty hard-hitting basslines, twisted sound design, bangin' progressions, with sprinkles of chunk and glitch.</p>
<p>The inspiration for Brian Peek when exercising complete crowd control emerges from his passion for everything about electronic music culture, particular the technical complexity involved in the creation process. Like many DJs, he started as an event participant which led him to hosting his own weekly radio show on his college radio station. Soon after, he began promoting regular events with Thump Radio and producing those radio shows for FM, Webcast, and XM Satellite. Brian Peek is a true professional who takes his craft seriously and has provided performance support for some of the globe's most well-known jocks, like Dylan Rhymes, Elite Force, Meat Katie, Ali B, D: Fuse, Roxiller, Fine Cut Bodies, Carbon Community, Future Funk Squad, Rennie Pilgrim, Hyper, General Midi, Uberzone, and Lee Burridge.</p>
<p>His first residency, with ThumpChill allowed him opportunities to share his love of his favorite music, while opening for acts like Hybrid, Jondi &amp; Spesh, Garth, Michael Anthony. This caught the attention of Ambient Mafia which afforded Brian the experience he needed to reach new heights. Since then, he has held down residencies at community staples like DNA Lounge, 550 Barneveld, and Anu. In 2009, he was invited to join Opulent Temple, including a prestigious DJ residency and contributions to artistic metal fabrications for one of the most well-known large scale sound camps in Burning Man history. In addition, he plays a significant role as executive producer of popular web podcasts for both Below Zero and Opulent Temple. Today, Brian's name is synonymous with Below Zero, including hosting a weekly event featuring downtempo on Wednesdays at Blowfish SF. Without a doubt, Brian Peek as a DJ delivers the full package proper in skill, talent, and undeniable passion for his full range of electronic sound.</p>

<p>Music is his cure! Ever since DJ Brian Williams could remember he has had a deep passion for music. Growing up, he enjoyed all types of music from rock to hip hop and everything in between. In his early twenty’s he was introduced to house music and instantly felt a deep connection. He had always enjoyed dancing but house music took it to a whole other level. He soon realized the only scene for him was a room filled with people dancing to his energetic beats. His stompy beats packed the house. It has been over 16 years since he started his musical journey. DJ Brian Williams has played at a variety of venues from Miami Winter Conference to LA. He has been a part of Opulent Temple for the last 6 years out of San Francisco, playing Love Fest for four years in a row, Burning Man, 1015 and End up.
