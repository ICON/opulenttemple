    <p>“I can still clearly remember the day I discovered electronic music. Standing in front of a speaker (still my favorite place), at a Friends and Family party in San Francisco. Something clicked, it made sense. While a lot of memories fade over time, that one doesn’t. The hard part came next. I knew I needed more of this music, but where to start? It wasn’t until a co-worker gave me Dave Seaman’s Renaissance Awakening that I knew where I wanted to be, and have never looked back. I’m now the guy will reply with a blank stare if asked about current non-electronic music.”</p>
    <p>Matt’s weapon of choice is Ableton Live. If one can think it, one can probably do it with this software, with enough work. Creativity is the only limiting factor. Matt’s been using Ableton for a three year’s at this point, and has only begun to crack into its possibilities. His mixes are frequently featured on Frisky Radio and the ProgressiveHouse.com’s ProgCast. He is a regular contributor at www.AbletonLiveDj.com, a website dedicated to increasing the knowledge pool centered around using Ableton Live as a DJ tool.</p>
    <p>Matt got involved with Opulent Temple at Burning Man in 2005 and has been playing with them since. He digs the thriving underground scene in San Francisco and enjoys the open-minded, conscious people that are drawn to electronic music.</p>
    <p>“I take pride in making each mix a standalone story. Making each mix its own ride allows me to not be tied down to a particular style, and keeps things fresh. I feel alive when mixing, and hope the listener enjoys what I’m trying to say.”</p>

    <p>The latest mix CD by Billy Casazza is entitled It’s Not Me It’s The Music, but he’s really just being humble. Because while somebody else could run out and buy the same records, nobody could spin the way he does, building an escapable vice that commands you to move. “I have always been around dance music and dancing, even when I was Kid,” says Casazza. Growing up on a diet of Front 242, New Order, Kraftwerk, and Nizter Ebb, it wasn’t long before he found electronic music and the love affair truly began. “The first time I heard electronic music I was hooked. I bought records for my friends to spin at all the high school dances in the late 80’s, at that time I had now idea how to DJ.” Although he admits that his main goal at the time was just dancing with the girls. During the early rave days he bounced around from party to party, in 97 he started to DJ out of frustration with the tired sounds he was hearing on the dance floor. “I figured I could buy the records I loved and play them-If they didn’t make me dance I wouldn’t buy them. I still live by that rule.</p>
    <p>Honing his skills and developing an unique blend of dark funky, tribal sounds, progressive and electro, and plenty of breaks for the dancers, Casazza quickly moved beyond the confines of California’s Central Valley where he is based, growing a devoted following in San Francisco’s best clubs. 1015, Ruby Skye, Mighty, Anu, 111 Minna, Mezzanine-Casazza has played them all, Djing alongside the likes of Dj Dan, Paul Oakenfold, Scumfrog, Rabbit in the Moon, Terry Mullan, Gene Farris, Hipp-e, Spesh, Soulslinger, RPO, Dylan Rhymes, Doc Martin, Garth, John Howard. As word of his talents spread he began getting International gigs. He played parties in Portugal, Romania, Egypt, Bali, Java, Mexico, Thailand, Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan, and Panama have all been rocked by Casazza.</p>
    <p>His Favorite gig? “Opulent Temple at Burning Man is always an experience, but Ecosystem 2.0 in the Amazon Rain Forest in front of 2000 people as the sun was coming up. I had to play after Ken Ishi and a psychtrance Dj, but some how, some way, everyone stuck around smiling and dancing, going off until 10 in the morning, .” It’s a long way from his first gig ( a tequila-fueled house party with the typically annoying request for commercial Hip Hop) but Casazza is a natural in front of crowds, whether its festivals like Burning Man or SF’s Love Fest Parade or the smallest dive bar.</p>
    <p>As Casazza continues to travel, and holds down a residency at Anu called Dose, and Opulent Temple, the next step is to focus on his own Label Nutbass Records. Nutbass has already released two 12”s that have been played by the likes of Jerry Bohnam, Gabriel and Dresden and Jondi and Spesh and have received good reviews in BPM, but Casazza wants more. The best thing in the world is to play your own songs and watch everyone dance and have fun,” he says. “My goal is to play just my own music. I think then I could consider myself a true artist” All modesty aside, just ask anyone losing it to one of his sets-they will tell you he is already an artist of the highest order.</p>

    <li><span class="subhead">Musical Flavors:</span> Techno &amp; Psy influenced Progressive Trance</li>
    <li><strong>"Dutch began his DJ career in 1989, before raves, ecstasy and trance music. As the early pioneers of electronic music began the conquest for North American dance floors, Dutch was already rocking his beat."</strong></li>

  <div id="dutch" class="info">
    <p>As the first waves of techno and electronica crashed on the shores of America, Dutch was plugging his headphones in. During the early years of his Dj career he was influenced by both acid house music and the harder techno sounds coming from Europe. The combination of his love for various styles of music and smooth mixing skills, quickly propelled his career and after the release of his mix, "Excapades in Trance", Dutch was being booked across the USA.</p>
    <p>In 1993, Dutch along with Dj Carlos and Christophe created the AREA 51 events. Attendance at these events topped 15,000 at "AREA 51 - Contact". These events allowed him freedom to be more creative with not only his music, but also the entire dance environment itself. Creating each event theme and also performing the parties allowed Dutch to create the perfect setting for the music he truly wanted his audience to hear. The new sounds of the underground were breaking through around the world and Dutch became the lens that focused this new sound on San Francisco.</p>
    <p>Around 1996 the psy-trance sound was being discovered around the world. Interested in the possibilities, Dutch began to seed this sound into each set. In 1999 while championing this new sound, Dutch Joined with Mason Rothert, Jim Seagel, Brian McDonald and Brian Dobson in creating Thump Radio. It wasn't long before his infamous San Francisco (((Thump))) Parties were legend. Artists like Infected Mushroom, Hallucinogen, GMS, Atmos, Vibrasphere, Ticon, Sun Project and Astral Projection, who had never performed in America, were welcomed on the (((Thump))) dance floor. (((THUMP))) soon became an important journey to North America for many trance artists and eventually paved the way for this new trance sound across the Americas.</p>
    <p>Currently, Dutch enjoys many types of music but focuses on the sounds of techo and tech house. His dance floor DJ sets average 126-130 BPM and are comprised of highly refined techno &amp; tech house. Melodic undertones coupled with hypnotic bass lines quickly distort time and space until the next thing you know, his set is over. Dutch's latest endeavor is the Opulent Temple, a Burning Man camp and collaborative group of DJ's and friends who work all year for a 6 day party at the end of the Summer.</p>

    <p>"I believe in compulsory dance music," says Opulent Temple resident Dex  Stakker. "I used to be more of a genre nazi, and a breakbeat purist,  but when you really dive into the electronic music scene, at at one  point in time, there is a glut of some style that was delivering quality  music five minutes ago, and burst of steam in some area that was boring  as hell last week. In looking back over your life, I think there are  plenty of songs, regardless of genre, that you've danced to that make  you shake your head in shame, wondering why. But songs that MADE you  dance, generally still do, regardless of how cheeseball they might seem  now. That's compulsory dance music."</p>
    <p>"In stocking a playlist for a night, I put this to qualifier to the  test, especially for filler material. There's enough out there, that  there should be nothing but killer filler in a set. I like when  mainstays like Sasha or Deep Dish pull that "other crate" of records out  around 3AM after the yo-yo's have partied themselves out. They'll pull  out progressive house and and trance-y tracks that at first glance seem  to be boring. Then slowly but surely you'll notice it: a sample, a  rhythmic bit, some arrangement trick, something that makes that song NOT  a waste of time."</p> 
    <p>"There's nothing more painful to me than a look of boredom in the eyes  of a dance floor. Keeping them interested, dancing and challenged  without selling my soul, well, that's the fun of it."</p>
    <p>Dex spins his characteristic mish-mosh of electrotechfunkybreaks (there  are five styles in there if you draw out the diagram) at the Opulent  Temple, and this last year burst onto the San Francisco scene in grand  fashion for a roookie, sharing stages and bills with such luminaries as  Meat Katie, Dylan Rhymes, Drumattic Twins, Carbon Community, Elite  Force, and Myagi.</p>

    <p>Tekfreaks are obvious legends in the making with a synergistic high-energy style and relentless obsession with destroying dance floors everywhere. The group was formed in early 2009, evolving out of the music culture petri dish of Burning Man and the San Francisco Bay Area. Jeff Taisch and Cosmic Selector began performing together alongside top international superstars at the legendary Opulent Temple events where they both have been core members and resident DJs for many years. Together they have been blowing away crowds with their own iconic signature style of hard driving electro and glitchy tech funk sound with a rebellious classic-rock flair. Much as it influences their sound selection, their old-school rockstar influence is unmistakable when you experience them perform live and witness them make a connection with every member of crowd making each show a truly live event. The infectious passion they hold for their music and the responsibility they feel as performers is authentic and energizing and never fails to resonate on the dance floor.</p>
    <p>The duo is currently blowing it up in and out of the studio with their slamming remixes and original tracks, known for dirty synth sounds, kicking baselines and fist pumping rocker style. TekFreaks are best known for some of their most iconic crowd pleasing remixes such as Green Day’s Brain Stew (TekFreaks Remix), Smashing Pumpkins’ Cherub Rock (TekFreaks Remix) and The Beatles’ Helter Skelter (TekFreaks Remix). Jeff and Cosmic Selector recently teamed up with Bay Area music culture revolutionary Syd Gris and the Boomrock Saints with support from Mephisto Odyssey with their remix of "Who Are You" on the Groove Quest label, as well as Mizumo Records, and many other bay area music heavyweights.</p> 
    <p>Jeff is currently signed to the record label Teknical Funk, producing both as a solo artist and as Tekfreaks. The label, which he co-founded with Cosmic Selector in 2010 is an unstoppable up-and-coming vehicle for many exciting genre-bending projects and inspiring collaborations. In early 2011Teknical Funk teamed up with U&amp;A DJ/producer Rektchordz from the UK for a west coast US tour with TekFreaks, and collaborated together in the studio to produce some forthcoming original work. The label has also begun hosting ‘burner’ style events in the Bay Area featuring international headliners and local heroes.</p>
    <p>Jeff’s distinctive style is constantly evolving as he is famous for blending his favorite elements from different genres in strange and wonderful ways along with his own envelope-pushing unique sounds. As a member of Tekfreaks he is currently exploring future trends in tech-funk, electro, rock and glitch, incorporating ever-heavier bass lines, dirtier wobbly sounds and fresher beats that have explosive energy, pack dance floors and keep dancers coming back for more. When he’s not busy producing as Tekfreaks, Jeff has been developing his own hybridized nu-dubstep, glitchhop and drumstep sounds.</p>
    <p>The last year has been a whirlwind of hard work, inspiring collaborations, epic parties and west coast touring. Jeff’s performance schedule keeps him busy most weekends, and he has been rocking the west coast in 2010 and 2011 with diverse bookings from San Francisco, LA, Reno, Boise, Portland, Black Rock City, as well as massives, campouts, renegades, radio shows and podcasts. He has been honored to share the decks with many of his favorite DJ’s and inspirations including Carl Cox, Calvertron, Tim Healey, Aphrodite, DJ Dan, JELO, Elite Force, Dylan Rhymes and many more.</p>
    <p>As a core member and resident DJ of Opulent Temple for many years Jeff has had the rare opportunity to hone his skills in the company of the largest continuing sound camp at burning man. As a community-based nonprofit organization and mighty Bay Area party crew, Opulent Temple is one of the hottest groups on the planet, with an old-school sense of ambition and community and mind boggling track record of success. Jeff has taken on event production and coordinating roles, and he plays a continuing role in the year-round management and extensive fundraising that brings Opulent Temple back to the playa each year. As a side project, Jeff has stepped up as a part of the Fire Effects and Safety crew, helping to design, engineer and facilitate the pyrotechnic effects that are mounted atop the iconic O-Pod DJ booth and can be seen from all over the playa shooting DJ-controlled pillars of flame each night at Burning Man. Jeff has been playing molten hot sets for the sea of ecstatic dancers at Opulent Temple as well as many other sound camps at Burning Man for several years. Catch him as he returns to the playa in 2011 as both Jeff Taisch and TekFreaks.</p>

  <div id="djicon" class="info">
    <p>Without doubt, DJ ICON has become an iconic figure in the U.S. dance music industry and beyond. With a career spanning a decade-and-a-half, she has captivated audiences the world over with her signature bass-heavy, vocal-infused, cross-genre Bass Music sound; magnetic stage presence, skillful DJ mixes and productions on Illeven Eleven Recordings. It’s no wonder why she’s been dubbed one of the leading ladies of this domain.</p>
    <p>Starting in 1996 at age 16, ICON diligently rose through the ranks of the San Francisco underground at a time when female DJs and promoters were few. In just a few years, her skills and growing reputation had already landed her numerous residencies in San Francisco, as well as a steady flow of multi-national bookings. ICON has also gained success in radio and television in addition to rocking dancefloors worldwide. Among her accolades are stellar reviews for her productions on Illeven Eleven Recordings, a spot in Shejay’s “Top 100 Female DJs”, being voted one of San Francisco’s best in the Nitevibe “Top 10 DJ Dreamteam” Poll, and also scoring a coveted sponsorship from Pioneer Pro DJ.</p>
    <p>Throughout her career, ICON has regularly toured throughout the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe and Asia at world renowned clubs such as 1015 Folsom and Ruby Skye in San Francisco, Limelight in NYC, Fabric and Matter in London, and Avalon in LA; as well as massive events such as Coachella Music Festival, Ultra Music Festival, Burning Man and Fuel Festival in Singapore. ICON has shared stages with top tier artists such as Underworld, The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method, Ladytron, Paul Oakenfold, Adam Freeland, Armand Van Helden, Deekline &amp; Wizard, The Stanton Warriors, The Freestylers, Evil Nine, Elite Force, Uberzone, Bassbin Twins, DJ Icey, DJ Rap and many more.</p> 
    <p>In addition to her international touring, ICON has also promoted many events in San Francisco and New York City over the years, including her Weapon of Choice series featuring the best international talent alongside local heroes.  This led to her popular Weapon of Choice DJ mix series that has accumulated over 20,000 downloads and thousands of plays on Soundcloud and Mixcloud.  She is also an integral member of the first female DJ collective, Sister SF, and the well-known large-scale sound camp at Burning Man, Opulent Temple.</p>
    <p>For many years, ICON dominated the radio waves with residencies and guest spots on a plethora of successful long-running dance music programs such as Thump Funk on XM, Boombox Mix Sessions on Sirius, Solid State on K-ROCK in NYC; IBreaks in the UK; and a myriad of shows in the San Francisco Bay Area, including House Nation on Wild 94.9 FM, Subsonic on Live 105, Zendada on Energy 92.7, and Future Breaks on KUSF. She has also made her way onto the small screen: In 2001, she was featured as one of twelve up-and-coming American DJs in “Disc Jockey,” a 12-part documentary series that aired on Showtime™ and ShoNext™. In 2004, she was the DJ on the internationally syndicated MTV™ series “The Wade Robson Project,” a dance competition hosted by the self-titled super choreographer.</p> 
    <p>ICON’s production endeavors have proven to be as exciting as her DJ career. Her first release on Illeven Eleven Recordings “Welcome To My Dancefloor”, a collaboration with Dustin Hulton featuring vocals by Nikki Carabello, had huge support by leading artists in the industry. It charted at #8 and #22 on the Beatport Breakbeat and Electro charts, also getting stellar reviews in Mixmag and Beatport top weekly picks. Her second release, “Wha?”, with studio partner Ground_Control, had equally stellar support and reviews; the Keith Mackenzie &amp; DJ Fixx remix charted at #12 on Beatport. Since then, ICON &amp; Ground_Control have been on a warpath making beats under their new moniker, ICONtrol. So what’s next for this powerhouse bass princess? More ICONtrol originals and remixes are in the works, as she continues to make her mark in the worldwide dance music industry. And if the last fifteen years have proven anything, the future will continue to bring big things from this driven and versatile performer.</p>

    <p>Brian Peek, resident DJ with Opulent Temple, is no newcomer to the industry. Rocking prime size crowds in San Francisco for the past six years, Brian focuses on mixing the highest quality of tunes across his full range of psy-breaks, electro, tech house, midtempo nu funk breaks, and downtempo. Dance floors at clubs and undergrounds all over the city have been mezmerized by the special touches he incorporates into his mixes, often encompassing sounds that have dirty hard-hitting basslines, twisted sound design, bangin' progressions, with sprinkles of chunk and glitch.</p>
    <p>The inspiration for Brian Peek when exercising complete crowd control emerges from his passion for everything about electronic music culture, particular the technical complexity involved in the creation process. Like many DJs, he started as an event participant which led him to hosting his own weekly radio show on his college radio station. Soon after, he began promoting regular events with Thump Radio and producing those radio shows for FM, Webcast, and XM Satellite. Brian Peek is a true professional who takes his craft seriously and has provided performance support for some of the globe's most well-known jocks, like Dylan Rhymes, Elite Force, Meat Katie, Ali B, D: Fuse, Roxiller, Fine Cut Bodies, Carbon Community, Future Funk Squad, Rennie Pilgrim, Hyper, General Midi, Uberzone, and Lee Burridge.</p>
    <p>His first residency, with ThumpChill allowed him opportunities to share his love of his favorite music, while opening for acts like Hybrid, Jondi &amp; Spesh, Garth, Michael Anthony. This caught the attention of Ambient Mafia which afforded Brian the experience he needed to reach new heights. Since then, he has held down residencies at community staples like DNA Lounge, 550 Barneveld, and Anu. In 2009, he was invited to join Opulent Temple, including a prestigious DJ residency and contributions to artistic metal fabrications for one of the most well-known large scale sound camps in Burning Man history. In addition, he plays a significant role as executive producer of popular web podcasts for both Below Zero and Opulent Temple. Today, Brian's name is synonymous with Below Zero, including hosting a weekly event featuring downtempo on Wednesdays at Blowfish SF. Without a doubt, Brian Peek as a DJ delivers the full package proper in skill, talent, and undeniable passion for his full range of electronic sound.</p>
