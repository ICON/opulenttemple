		<title>The Opulent Temple Podcasts</title>
		<link>http://media.mvgals.net/ot/ot_podcast/</link>
		<description>The Opulent Temple started as a large scale art &amp; music theme camp at the annual Burning Man arts festival that takes place in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, celebrated the week before Labor Day. We throw nightly parties showcasing underground world class electronic dance music in a setting of art and creation we've made ourselves. The effort is self generated by the tribe and no one gets paid to create our production. On the contrary, key members put much of their own time, effort, and sometimes money all year around into bringing it back every year. Our community and fund raising events are based in San Francisco and though our production is associated with the BM event, we will be taking it to other settings. 

The Opulent Temple Podcast shines the spotlight on the resident djs of the OT family and features mixes exploring the diverse musical flavors of underground electronica, including electro, progressive, techno, breaks, tech funk, indie/nu-disco, trance, and a dash of dubstep-glitch. This show consists of Opulent Temple residents and special guests. You can learn more about Opulent Temple, our djs, music, events, community happenings, and everything else in between, by visiting us online at Opulent Temple dot org.</description>

								<title>Opulent Temple Podcast #36 - Syd Gris live Thursday night @ Opulent Temple 2009</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>Armin Van Buuren and agent David Lewis came out (yes, on their own dime) to play Thursday night 2009, alongside Infected Mushroom. Syd Gris paid off his diligence by scheduling himself to open and dip back in to a rare progressive set at Burning Man.</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ It had been a goal of mine to get Armin to come to Burning Man since there was an OT.  Having come up in the trance scene of the late 90's, dancing to early huge Armin tracks like 'Blue Fear' on Jerry Bonham's Spundae releases, it was a tenacious effort of chats over cocktails w Armin and his management whenever they would role through SF.  Having won the #1 spot in DJ Mag's worldwide poll, he was well acquainted with their editor at the time, Leslie Wright (who wrote a 6 page feature article about OT for DJ Mag in 2008, read it here: opulenttemple.org/archives/000139.php )  During the London party celebrating his repeat victory again in 2008 later that year, she cornered his agent, spit in her hand, made him do the same, and made him promise he'll route Armin through OT the following year.  And so it was.  Armin Van Buuren and agent David Lewis came out (yes, on their own dime) to play Thursday night 2009, alongside Infected Mushroom.  I paid off my diligence by scheduling myself to open and dip back in to a rare progressive set at Burning Man.  Everyone 'knows' Burners aren't big on trance, but of course, as predicted, they were there by the thousands to see Armin and I saw my job as not trying to bring the house down with big tracks, but to set him up with a solid steady progressive offering with melody and muscle.  This is that set. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ ELiKi has been playing with music since the age of 7 when he picked up his first clarinet. Now at 22, he's been a punk rocker, hip hopper and now he finally knows he's found his love; Providing people with fun parties to go to and making people dance. Over the past 3 years ELiKi and friend Olivia Balmain, have thrown renegades in Golden Gate Park and held down residencies in clubs all over San Francisco under their Frisco Fidget Production company. 2010 was the first year ELiKi camped with Opulent Temple, and he can't imagine doing it any other way. &quot;The feeling I got every night at OT can never be compared. Knowing that I was a part of the amazing group that worked hours on end to bring this spectacle to the playa gives me the craziest feeling of accomplishment... I can't wait to do it over and over again.&quot;&quot;This mix was inspired to me by the great DJs I'm surrounded by week in and week out thanks to my OT homies.

								<itunes:subtitle>This Opulent Temple mix is a culmination of recent influences in psy and techno.</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[   J.B. Vries picked up a guitar at the ripe age of 13 and never looked back. During his early music career he aspired more towards being the next Slash from Guns n' Roses than a club DJ and only became infatuated with electronic beats when first exposed to ATB, The Chemical Brothers, and Paul Van Dyk. The electronic sounds were enticing to say the least and almost overnight the aspiring heavy metal guitarist set his sights on becoming a club thumping DJ and producer.Today, J.B. lives in Downtown San Francisco where he continues to produce, DJ, and progress as a musician and performer.&quot;This Opulent Temple mix is a culmination of recent influences in psy and techno. My recent collaborations with OT Resident DJ Billy Casazza have resulted in a tried and tested stompfest of a tune titled 'Running WIld', scheduled to release April 26th on Dichotic Recordings. The Trevor Flynn remix is 4th up in this mix and wrapping up this mix is a single one of my singles titled &quot;Pre-Fade&quot;, also forthcoming on Dichotic.

								<title>Opulent Temple Podcast #26 - Zach Moore live Friday Night at Opulent Temple, Burningman 2009</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>This recording of my set from Opulent Temple in 2009 features several variations of house music which I rarely play in my live sets these days, and I think it gives away my Deep End roots a little too. I hope you enjoy it!</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ My days as both a fan and supporter of Opulent Temple date back to before I became a serious DJ, so it was both a thrill and an honor to play at the camp for the very first time at Burning Man back in 2009. I played in the late afternoon on Friday and up to that point most of my Burning Man sets were primarily breaks so I was feeling ready for a change of style. This recording of my set from Opulent Temple in 2009 features several variations of house music which I rarely play in my live sets these days, and I think it gives away my Deep End roots a little too. I hope you enjoy it!Many thanks to Syd Gris, Jeff, Dex, Dutch, Dulce, Cos and the entire OT crew for inviting me to play. And thank you to Brian Peek and Mark Rahmani, who do a fantastic job with the OT podcast, for having me on the show. Long live the Opulent Temple!A little background on Zach Moore....An Ohio native and a San Francisco resident of seventeen years, Zach Moore is best known in the San Francisco dance community for his affiliation with The Space Cowboys (Jan '10-present) and The Deep End (2006-2009) and for the two weekly iTunes podcasts he produces, The Space Cowboys' RIPEcast and The Gough Street Sessions. Over the years, Zach's love for electronic music has run the gamut (deep, vocal, tech, progressive &amp; electro house, breakbeat and techno) but of late the focus of his live sets and recorded mixes has been the breakbeat and tech funk genres. Among the artists that most heavily influence Zach's style are Soul of Man, Slyde, Plaza de Funk and Krafty Kuts, The Stanton Warriors, DeeKline, Elite Force/Zodiac Cartel, Meat Katie and Dylan Rhymes. For more background on Zach, visit him at djzachmoore.com.

His presence behind the decks is super-charged and full of energy.&quot;Yep, Burning Man is one of a kind,&quot; nods Ali. &quot;The desert is like a big blank canvas or the white walls of a gallery and for one week a year it gets filled to the brim with all sorts of crazy stuff - moving and stationary artwork, music, crazy vehicles, bikes, costumes and lots of fire.&quot; Ali B, founder of Air Recordings, definitely adds a big splash of modern edge with his colorful brand of raw funk. ]]></itunes:summary>

Its a time to celebrate the closing of an epic evening into arrival of a new day. Having seen my first ever sunrise at Burning Man from behind the turntables at Opulent Temple in 2006, it was only fitting to close my 5th and favorite year with a celebration and tribute to my time spent on the playa. This is a mix of my favorite melodic morning breaks along with a few fav's from throughout the week.  ]]></itunes:summary>

								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ Recorded using CDJ1000's on a Pioneer DJM800 (Not Ableton) at the Opulent Temple Sacred Dust party, November 2010. The mix speaks for itself. It was one of those nights where everything goes perfectly. If you were there, you know what I'm talking about. The temperature in the room went up a good 10 degrees. I've been experimenting with a bit more sample work than normal, clearly apparent in the first half a dozen tracks. The rest is pure raw power tech. I even mashed up a couple Glitter tracks at the end before rounding it off with that new John Digweed track. I am diggin' it and I'm sure you'll be diggin' it with me. Watch your bassbins with this one, it's mastered hot. ]]></itunes:summary>

His mixing across these genres is impressive and spot on and you'll find yourself immersed in the sound scapes at times for a true back to the playa transporting. The set sounds fresh and different though you might recognize some of the tracks, the programming from one place to the next makes the whole set have it's own unique cohesion. ]]></itunes:summary>

How would I follow up a set to a track as huge as this one? Fortunately for you, the answer turned out better than anticipated. Expect hard-hitting breaks, dirty basslines, detailed production and twisted sound design from the likes of Funkatech Records, Dead Famous, and Broken Robot Records, just to name a few. ]]></itunes:summary>

There's plenty of time before hand to ask yourself what you want to do and what path you want your set to take.
