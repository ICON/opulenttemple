			<title>Opulent Temple Podcast #001 | Syd Gris live Saturday Burning Man 2009</title>
			<description>The Opulent Temple started as a Large Scale Art and Music theme camp at the annual Burning Man arts festival that takes place in the Black Rock desert of Nevada the week before Labor Day. We throw nightly parties showcasing underground, world class electronic dance music in a setting of art and creation we've made ourselves. The effort is self generated by the tribe, ie., no one gets paid to create our production. On the contrary, key members put a lot of their own time, effort, and sometimes money all year around to to bring it back every year. Our community and fund raising events are based in San Francisco, and though our production is associated with the BM event, we will be taking it to other settings.   The Opulent Temple Podcast shines the spotlight on the resident djs of the OT family- featuring mixes exploring the diverse musical flavors of underground electronica- including electro, progressive, techno, breaks, tech funk, indie/nu-disco, trance, and a dash of dubstep-glitch. This show consists of Opulent Temple residents and special guests. You can learn more about Opulent Temple, our djs, music, events, community happenings, and everything else in between, by visiting us online at http://www.OpulentTemple.org</description>
